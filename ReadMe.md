# Furret Zero Unleashed!

This is a fork of Unleashed where I've added some custom Furret animations and sprinkled in some other Pokemon into the firmware (found in the [RogueMaster firmware](https://github.com/RogueMaster/flipperzero-firmware-wPlugins))!


**This firmware is a fork from** [DarkFlippers/unleashed-firmware](https://github.com/DarkFlippers/unleashed-firmware)

**...Which is a fork from** [flipperdevices/flipperzero-firmware](https://github.com/flipperdevices/flipperzero-firmware)

I intend to occasionally update this firmware to keep up with Unleashed.
