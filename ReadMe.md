This is a fork of Unleashed where I've added some custom Furret animations and sprinkled in some other Pokemon into the firmware!

Non-Furret assets found in the [RogueMaster firmware](https://github.com/RogueMaster/flipperzero-firmware-wPlugins).

I intend to occasionally update this firmware to keep up with Unleashed.
